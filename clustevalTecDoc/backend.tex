	\section{Backend}
	The backend of the framework is responsible for all calculations. It consists of a server and a client component. The server takes commands from the client and does the calculations internally and in a multithreaded way. The client can query the server to get the current status of a calculation or to give commands to the server which might control current processes. Figure \ref{fig_backend} shows the general structure of the backend and the components it contains.
